# LibraryFeedbackSystem
University Project (2021 SLIIT 3rd Year 1st Semester)

Scenario: 
Getting feedback from all readers from the library and the librarians to create a catalogue (database) about their favourite books of respective categories and opinions on them. The system will be set-up at the books borrowing counter so the readers can participate in the program before heading out about the whole experience.

Client Side: 
The system will display a series of multiple-choice questions about the currently popular books and a place to enter their choice of book in a respective category.

Server Side: 
The system should show the most voted books and most read books of each category so the library workers can get extra books to cover their popularity and suggest new readers interesting books to read.
